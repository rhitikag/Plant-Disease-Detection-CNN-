# Plant-Disease-Detection-CNN-
A deep learning-based approach for identifying plant leaf diseases using image classification. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and categorize plant diseases from large image datasets â€” improving accuracy over traditional visual inspection

# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Identification

This project focuses on **automatically identifying plant diseases** using deep learning techniques.  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on plant leaf images to classify diseases accurately, helping farmers and researchers detect issues early and improve crop health.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

Plant disease detection is crucial for sustainable agriculture. Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone â€” this notebook applies computer vision to make diagnosis faster and more reliable.

### Models Explored
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet variants)
- Traditional ML Baselines for comparison

### Objectives
- Preprocess and augment large plant image datasets  
- Train and evaluate CNN-based models  
- Compare results to identify the most robust architecture
